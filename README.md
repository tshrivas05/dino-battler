# dino-battler
A fun little game my baby cousin and I came up with to put his extensive dinosaur knowledge to use! We used Python classes to define what a dinosaur was and the battler essentially uses conditionals to determine who wins each battle. You can run as many battles as you'd like!

## Dinosaur.py
This file has the class structure of dinosaurs

## Nivu.py
This file contains dinosaur creation (instantiation) and functions to pit dinosaurs against one another in battle + print it out >:)
